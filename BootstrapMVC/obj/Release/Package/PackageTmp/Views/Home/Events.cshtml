            <b>Crossing Guard</b><br />
            Volunteer Crossing Guard
        </p>
        <p>We are asking for volunteers to assist our students during drop-off on Tamarack Drive. Crossing guards play an important role in the lives of children who walk or bicycle to school by helping them safely cross the street at key locations. A guard also helps children develop the skills to cross streets safely at all times. They remind drivers of the presence of pedestrians.  </p>
        <p>LOCATION: Tamarak Drive <a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F0849A4AA22ABFD0-volunteer" target="_blank">SIGN UP HERE</a></p>
        <p><b>Garden Compost</b></p>
        <p>We need help aerating our compost bin. This task can be done at anytime that the school is open. I have put dates on the sign-up as a suggestion, but you can choose your own schedule. This only needs to be done once a month. </p>
        <ol>
            Directions:
            <li>Get pitchfork or shovel from supply closet by the front desk.</li>
            <li>Shovel compost from one bin to another so that the compost is fully mixed.</li>
            <li>Clean shovel with the water hose in the garden.</li>
            <li>Return shovel to supply closet.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>Recycling</b></p>
        <p>The school collects plastic bottles for recycling. We turn these water bottles in at local recycling centers and get money for them. This is a continuous revenue stream that supports the PTO and is part of our commitment to environmental protection.We need volunteers to bring the recycled bottles to the center and bring the proceeds back to the school. Click here for a list of centers you can use: <a href="http://replanetusa.com/replanet_locations.html" target="_blank">http://replanetusa.com/replanet_locations.html</a></p>
        <p>The dates listed are suggestions only; you can do this anytime that fits into your schedule. Most locations ask that the water bottles are completely empty, and sometimes they may require the removal of the bottle caps. Please sign up below and speak with Ms. Melanie at the Front Desk for more specific instructions.</p>
