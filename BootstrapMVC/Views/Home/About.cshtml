        <p style="text-align: justify;">Our key mission is to promote an environment at school where teachers and administrators can do their best work and our students can do their best learning. We're always eager to find more great people, like you, to help us meet this goal.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We don't expect a huge time commitment from volunteers. An hour can be a big help to our group and the school, and we have positions and tasks to fit all schedules and interests. Just let us know whether a program, event, or activity interests you and when you might be free to help. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Research shows that students whose parents are involved in their education have better grades and fewer discipline problems. Involvement at the school also makes it easier to establish friendships with teachers and other parents. We promise that the time you give our group and the school will be worth your while - and fun!</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Feel free to e-mail the president of the PTO at <a href="mailto:president@mhmspto.org">president@mhmspto.org</a> if you have any questions. Together, we can make a difference at our school!</p>*@
